                "The S1C17W22/W23 is a 16-bit microcontroller that features low-voltage operation from 1.2 V even though Flash memory is included. The embedded high-efficiency DC-DC converter generates the constant-voltage to drive the IC with lower power consumption than 4-bit microcontrollers. It is suitable for battery-driven applications that require an LCD display and timers."

The embedded high-efficiency DC-DC converter generates the constant-voltage to drive the IC with lower power consumption than 4-bit microcontrollers. It is suitable for battery-driven applications that require an LCD display and timers.",
