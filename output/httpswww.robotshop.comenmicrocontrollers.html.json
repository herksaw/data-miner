While there are plenty of sensors that allow robots to glimpse their surroundings, one category of sensors that is rapidly gaining popularity is light and laser-based (LiDAR) distance measurement/object detection. In this article, we will go over the different characteristics, the various types of sensors, their typical use cases and some of the products that we currently offer with these features.",

While there are plenty of sensors that allow robots to glimpse their surroundings, one category of sensors that is rapidly gaining popularity is light and laser-based (LiDAR) distance measurement/object detection. In this article, we will go over the different characteristics, the various types of sensors, their typical use cases and some of the products that we currently offer with these features.",
